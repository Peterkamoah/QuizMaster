## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

Follow these instructions to get the project set up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18 or later is recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

### Setup

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project by copying the example file.
    ```bash
    cp .env .env.local
    ```
    You will need a Google AI API key to use the quiz generation feature. Add it to your `.env.local` file:
    ```
    GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```
    You can get a free key from the [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

3.  **Run the development servers:**
    The application requires two processes to run concurrently: the Next.js frontend and the Genkit AI service.

    *   **In your first terminal, start the Genkit service:**
        ```bash
        npm run genkit:watch
        ```

    *   **In a second terminal, start the Next.js application:**
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```

    The application should now be available at `http://localhost:9002`.
