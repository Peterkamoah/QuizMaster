## ðŸ”§ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project set up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18 or later recommended)
*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project by copying the `.env` file.
    ```bash
    cp .env .env.local
    ```
    You will need a Google AI API key to use the quiz generation feature. Add it to your `.env.local` file:
    ```
    GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```
    You can get a key from the [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

### Running the Development Server

The application requires two processes to run concurrently: the Next.js frontend and the Genkit AI flows.

1.  **Start the Genkit development service:**
    Open a terminal and run:
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:watch
    ```
    This will start the Genkit flows and watch for any changes you make to them.

2.  **Start the Next.js application:**
    Open a second terminal and run:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

The application should now be running at `http://localhost:9002`.
